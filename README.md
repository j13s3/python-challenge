Data Analytics Boot Camp - Module 3 Challenge - Python Programming - Jalaj Sharma

For PyBank:

1. Import the Python modules

2. Provide with file paths for the raw data and output file

3. Declare and initialise variables and lists

4. Read the file contents

    a. Record/skip the header data
    
    b. As each row is analysed, totalise the number of months

    c. Aggregate the total amount of money gained/lost

    d. For simplicity, instead of using the min/max function, use IF statements to identify the minimum and maximum profit/loss years

5. Calculate the average profit/lost

6. Print statements out to the terminal

7. Write various details into the output text file

For PyPoll:

1. Import the Python modules

2. Provide with file paths for the raw data and output file

3. Declare and initialise variables and lists

4. Read the file contents

    a. Record/skip the header data

    b. Create a list of all the candidate names - using this list, all computation will be done

5. The total number of votes is the length of the candidate names list

6. Create a list of unique candidate names (no duplicates)

7. Declare and initialise variables for tackling specific candidate votes

8. Start with partial Print statements to terminal

9. Using a FOR loop, go through the full candidate votes list and identify and totalise the number of occurrences of each item in the 'no duplicates' list using the Count function

10. Identify the most voted candidate using the Index and Max function

11. Finalise all Print statements to terminal

12. Write various details into the output text file
